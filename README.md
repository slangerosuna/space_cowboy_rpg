# Space Cowboy RPG

## inspiration

The primary inspirations to this project are Skyrim, Doug Doug's [babadaboosh](https://github.com/DougDougGithub/Babagaboosh.git), Joon Sung et. al.'s [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents), and my friends TTRPG setting.

## build

Currently, the entirety of the build can be done with cargo, but you have to run `setup.sh` on linux or `setup.bat` on windows in order to install the binaries in resources and save the api keys to the config.toml file.

## contribution

Currently, this is being run by just me and nobody else, so contribution rules are subject to change. If you do wish to contribute, please reach out to me on discord at sofialo
