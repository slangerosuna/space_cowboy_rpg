# Space Cowboy RPG

## inspiration

The primary inspirations to this project are Skyrim, Doug Doug's [babadaboosh](https://github.com/DougDougGithub/Babagaboosh.git), Joon Sung et. al.'s [Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents), and my friends TTRPG setting.

## build

Download [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM), extract it, rename it to word2vec.bin, and place it in the `resources` folder

Next you need to setup your `config.toml` file using any text editor
when done setting up, it should look something like this

```toml
openapi_key = API_KEY
azure_key = API_KEY
elevenlabs_key = API_KEY
```
